🏡 House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
This project implements a simple linear regression model to predict house prices based on house size. It uses Python and scikit-learn to train a model, split the data into training and testing sets, and visualize the regression line. The goal is to demonstrate the fundamentals of machine learning with a straightforward example.

🔧 Features:
Data splitting using train_test_split

Model training with LinearRegression

Reshaping input data for compatibility

Prediction and model evaluation

Plotting the regression line (optional)

🧰 Tools & Libraries:
Python

NumPy

scikit-learn

Matplotlib (for visualization)
